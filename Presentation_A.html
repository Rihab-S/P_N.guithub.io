        <h2>Context and Problem Statement</h2>

        <div class="alternate">
            <div class="text">
                <p>Product returns on Amazon represent a significant cost for many stores and impact customer satisfaction. Identifying high-risk products <strong>before they are listed</strong> is essential to optimize inventory and reduce losses.</p>
                
                <p>The proposed AI solution provides a fast and efficient approach to predict the <strong>return risk of a product</strong>. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of AI-based prediction before a full-scale deployment.</p>
                
                <p>The prototype typically includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An AI model capable of assessing the return risk for each product.</li>
                    <li>A visualization interface displaying products and their associated risk score.</li>
                    <li>A demonstration based on existing data (price, description, reviews, ASIN, images).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Importance of this project:</strong> Testing AI effectiveness before developing a complete solution helps reduce financial and technical risks, while providing actionable insights for product management.</p>
                
                <p><strong>This interface provides you with complete documentation of the proposed solution, a test module to evaluate any product available on Amazon, as well as a “Perspectives” section presenting the next steps for improving the model.</strong></p>

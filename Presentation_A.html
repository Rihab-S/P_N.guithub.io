    <h2>Context and Problem Statement</h2>

    <div class="alternate">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Product returns on Amazon represent a significant cost for Ponera and affect customer satisfaction. Identifying high-risk products <strong>before they are listed</strong> is essential to optimize inventory and reduce losses.</p>
            <p>The proposed MVP (Minimum Viable Product) serves as a fast and effective technical solution to predict the <strong>return risk of a product</strong>. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of AI-based prediction before a full deployment.</p>
            <p>The MVP typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An AI model capable of evaluating the return risk for each product.</li>
                <li>A visualization interface showing products and their associated risk scores.</li>
                <li>A demonstration based on available data (price, description, reviews, ASIN, images).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Importance of the MVP:</strong> Testing the AI effectiveness before developing a complete solution reduces financial and technical risks while providing actionable insights for product management.</p>
            <p><strong>This interface provides you with comprehensive documentation of the proposed solution, a testing module to evaluate any product available on Amazon, and a “Perspectives” section outlining the next steps for improving the model.</strong></p>

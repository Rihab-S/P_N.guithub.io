                <p>Our perspectives for the MVP aim to enhance prediction accuracy and enrich decision-making capabilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a large and diverse database to train the AI model, capturing a wide range of product return scenarios.</li>
                    <li>Add the number of sales and historical volume for each product to weigh the return risk according to popularity and purchase trends.</li>
                    <li>Integrate more product features, such as categories, detailed descriptions, customer reviews, and return history, to improve model robustness.</li>
                    <li>Develop an intuitive interface that allows teams to easily visualize each product's risk score and make informed decisions.</li>
                    <li>Implement a continuous monitoring system to compare predictions with actual returns and progressively refine the model.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> These improvements will not only reduce return-related costs but also provide strategic insights to commercial and logistics teams to optimize stock management and customer satisfaction.</p>
